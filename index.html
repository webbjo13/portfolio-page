            <h2>Hi! I'm Johnny Webb</h2>

            <p>I am currently an underground utility worker that is working his way             toward becoming a software developer.</p>
            <p>I live in Rolesville, NC which is just outside of Raleigh, NC. 
             Raleigh is becoming a large area for the computer career field.</p>

            <h2>About Johnny</h2>

            <p>I have always enjoyed playing and working with computers and after   
             graduating from college I ended up in construction while trying to  
             get a few computer certifications. Software development was not what I 
             orignally wanted to do with computers but it is turning into something 
             that I enjoy.</p>
            <p>I have always had a passion for problem solving and fixing things and I am
              realizing that there is a large amount of problem solving in web development.
              I really enjoy writing code now that I understand it and I can't wait to learn
              even more coding skills. I also really enjoy working with others in teams
              because two or more minds are always better than one. I have learned a lot from
              others and I prefer to have people to bounce ideas off of. Coding collaboration 
              is something I am really looking forward to.</p>
            <p>I am hoping to break into the software development field after my 
             time at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. So far I am 
             really enjoying my time in the program and I am learning a ton. I think the 
             farther I get into the program the more my passion for web development
             will blossom.</p>
            <p>I do have some other hobbies when I am not at work or doing the     
              program that include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Playing pool</li>
              <li>Working out</li>
              <li>Traveling to new areas</li>
            </ul>
